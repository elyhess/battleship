# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  - best practices, using TDD
  - organization/planning and conceptual understand
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  - ping-pong & driver/navigator
  - divide/conquer for refactor
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  - slack messages - keeping in touch with schedule related things
  - video/call for struggles / touch-base
* How would you describe your work style?
  - Sam: divide-conquer, works best at night, goal-oriented w/ plan
  - Ely: divide-conquer, works best in morning, goal-oriented w/ plan
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  - Sam: pivoting, taking different approaches
  - Ely: tenacity, flexibility
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  - Sam: knowing when to take a break, even when progressing. When to stop
  - Ely: getting stuck on something, not knowing when to pivot or take break
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  - quiet workspace, dedicated time
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  - we will shoot to work atleast 1 hour/day - more if necessary
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  - we have both agreed to give feedback unconditionally, not take feedback as insult, and keep the greater good in front of mind
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  - slack, open communication
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  - acknowledge when there is a lack of understanding, work to resolve via screenshare/slack/etc..
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  - Set goals, product passes all tests, and meets all requirements
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  - touch base will include comments on what each member did successfully followed by literal back pat and clap




### Template for DTR Memo

Project: battleship

  - timely communication/project delivery
  - complete iteration 4
  - score 4 on each rubric category
  - improve git workflow from last project

Team strengths:
  - goal oriented
  - flexibility
  - communication

How to overcome obstacles:
  - time - overcome by setting standards and regularly checking in to make sure on time.
  - communication - slack calls, scheduled touch-bases
  - lack conceptual knowledge - accepting not knowing something, and knowing when to pivot to a different approach

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
 - whoever is driving will be doing pull requests for whichever sections they drive for
 - pull request per session

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  - professional, constructive criticism
  - be accepting to criticism, know that it comes from wanting the best possible result

  - Every end of session, summarize things that went well/what didn't go well

Agenda to discuss project launch:
  - two days before start planning launch
  - able to explain project in and out easily

Ideas:

  - hashes vs arrays
  - use .random to generate computer's next move
  - read the actual rules of the game battleship

Tools:
  - rubydocs
  - minitest
  - stackoverflow
  - google

  - arrays/hashes
  - .random
